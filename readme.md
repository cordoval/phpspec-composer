Instructions
============

```sh
git clone git://github.com/cordoval/phpspec-composer.git
cd phpspec-composer
```

If you already have composer installed system wide then move on to the next step:

```sh
wget http://getcomposer.org/composer.phar
php composer.phar install
```

If you have composer installed as in a development setup then do:

```sh
composer install
```

And now just run phpspec with:

```sh
./phpspec-composer.php -h
```
